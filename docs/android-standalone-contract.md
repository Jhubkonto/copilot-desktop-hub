# Android standalone data and capability contract

Contract version: 2. Reviewed against the Android screens, `WsRepository`, `WsEvent`, desktop
WebSocket handlers, and database migrations on 2026-07-31.

## Identifier policy

- New projects, agents, conversations, messages, reusable-content records, outbox operations,
  conflicts, drafts, and attachment references use lowercase RFC 4122 UUID v4 strings.
- Android has one stable UUID device identity. It survives upgrades and is never synchronized as
  user content.
- A dataset identity is the first 24 hexadecimal characters of SHA-256 over the pairing token.
  Android binds its local database to the first dataset and refuses synchronization with another
  saved desktop profile.
- Attachment content identity is the lowercase 64-character SHA-256 digest of the bytes. Transfer
  deduplication never relies on filenames, timestamps, or paths.
- Outbox ordering uses `(deviceId, deviceSequence)`; wall-clock timestamps are display metadata and
  never decide conflict winners.

## Canonical synchronized records

| Entity | Canonical fields | Android-owned local fields | Excluded fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project | `id`, `name`, `color`, portable `config`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | sync status/version | root/workspace paths, secrets |
| Agent | `id`, `name`, `icon`, `backend`, `cliModel`, portable `config`, timestamps | sync status/version | credentials, local paths |
| Conversation | `id`, `title`, agent/project/model IDs, `pinned`, timestamps | draft, summary, sync status | active stream state |
| Message | `id`, conversation ID, role/content/model/provider, finish reason, usage, attachments, thinking, timestamp | partial/failure and sync status | inline attachment bytes |
| Wiki | `id`, project ID, title/body/tags/source conversation, timestamps | sync status/version | none |
| Prompt | `id`, title/body/description/category/tags/scope/project ID, timestamps | sync status/version | none |
| Skill | portable versioned configuration, ID, timestamps | sync status/version | filesystem paths and secrets |
| Attachment | attachment/message IDs, display name, MIME type, size, SHA-256 | local path and transfer state | local path; bytes travel only in verified chunks |

Unknown optional JSON fields are retained in canonical payload JSON. Malformed optional JSON is
treated as an empty/default value rather than crashing or silently replacing a pending local edit.
API keys, authorization values, passwords, pairing secrets, data URLs, base64 payload fields,
workspace/root/local paths, transient streams, logs, build state, and device settings are removed
recursively at both synchronization boundaries.

## Android capability matrix

| Area/action | Offline | Internet, no desktop | Paired desktop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Startup/navigation/settings/appearance | Local | Local | Local |
| Conversation list, search, rename, pin, delete, branch | Local + queued sync | Local + queued sync | Local/desktop synchronization |
| Draft composition and restoration | Local durable | Local durable | Local durable |
| Send/regenerate/stop standalone chat | Draft only | Direct provider | Direct provider or desktop execution |
| Agent create/edit/delete/config | Local + queued sync | Local + queued sync | Synchronized |
| Project create/rename/delete/portable config | Local + queued sync | Local + queued sync | Synchronized |
| Prompt, skill, and wiki browse/search/CRUD | Local + queued sync | Local + queued sync | Synchronized |
| Provider keys and endpoint validation | Read encrypted config | Direct provider API | Android-local keys; optional desktop provider view |
| Attachment selection/storage | Local content-addressed | Direct provider upload | Resumable peer synchronization |
| Sync summary, failed-operation inspection/retry/discard | Cached status | Cached status | Active synchronization |
| Conflict review/resolution | Review only | Review only | Resolve Android/desktop value |
| Backup, restore, integrity check, diagnostics export | Local | Local | Local |
| Artifacts and workspace-writing generators | Desktop required | Desktop required | Desktop execution |
| Builds, shell, Git, code changes, CLI backends | Desktop required | Desktop required | Desktop execution |
| Local stdio MCP, desktop automation, scheduled execution | Desktop required | Desktop required | Desktop execution |
| Tool approval or stopping an active desktop process | Disabled, never queued | Disabled, never queued | Live desktop only |
| HTTP remote MCP | Not enabled | Not enabled | Not enabled; requires separate threat model |

## State dimensions

UI state keeps desktop connectivity, internet connectivity, execution target, data freshness,
pending/failed operation counts, synchronization progress, conflicts, last success, and active chat
turns separate. Disconnecting does not clear Room-backed lists or reinterpret cached data as fresh.

## Protocol envelope

Protocol 2 negotiates Room sync schema, entity types, attachment support, a maximum batch size,
and a durable desktop change cursor. A valid cursor receives only changed entities; protocol 1
remains supported as a full-snapshot compatibility fallback.
Mutations carry operation ID, device ID/sequence, entity ID/type, base version, operation, canonical
payload, and display timestamp. Metadata is applied before message bodies; messages are prioritized
for the visible conversation and committed in bounded transactions so global hydration yields to
interactive chat work.
Attachment manifests use SHA-256 and transfer at most 64 KB per chunk, resuming from the receiver's
reported offset.

Chat history uses a separate request-correlated flow. The latest 20 messages are validated by a
content hash and can return `not-modified`; changed pages stream newest-first in batches of at most
10 messages or 128 KB. Older pages remain 60 messages and load only on upward pagination.
